IRA withdrawal for first time home purchase. Closing was delayed, and I wound up not using all of the money, how do I roll it back or contribute it back past 60 days?

I used my IRA for a first time home purchase. My closing was delayed about a month, and I found out a day or two before closing that a city grant covered most of my closing costs. Unfortunately, I got this news after the 60 day rollover period due to the delay at my bank.
I've read if there is a delay or cancellation I have 120 days to roll money back, but my bank says they won't rollover past 60 and that all exemptions are handled on the IRS's end. Can I put the money back in as a contribution to avoid penalty (within 120 days)? How do I prove it was delayed? I did still wind up using most of the money, but not all of it. Not sure how this is handled.
