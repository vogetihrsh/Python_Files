what should i enter for Cash, or loan amount (or both), paid with trade-in?

I know this has been asked a few times earlier too but unfortunately the answers from so called tax experts have been very confusing at best.  Here is a straight forward question to which i am expecting a straight forward answer.

As others have pointed out, your standard text book answers are not helping anyone, seriously. Could you please not copy paste the answers from your tax books and add more clarity? it is a simple question, if you paid A = $5000 down payment, took an additional loan of say B = $10000 and received C = $2000 as the trade in value for your old car, how much should I enter? Is it $17000 (A + B + C) or is it $13000 (A + B - C)? If you seriously want to help out, you should provide a straight forward answer.
