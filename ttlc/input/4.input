How do I find my Employer Identification Number (EIN)?
To e-file your return, you'll need to provide your employer's identification number, or EIN. The best place to look is in Box b of your W-2 form, located right above your employer's name and address (or in some cases, right below).

The EIN will be a 9-digit number with a dash after the second digit, like this: XX-XXXXXXX.

If you don't have your W-2, there are other places you can look. (By the way, you won't find the EIN on your paystub or paycheck.)

Last year's W-2, assuming you're working for the same employer and kept Copy C (for employee records) with your tax return paperwork.
Online. Search for your company's annual report (10-K filing), for example "Amalgamated Conglomerated 10-K," "ACME annual report," etc.
The EIN will be labeled IRS Employer Identification No. and is usually on the first page.
This only works for publicly-traded companies (those with a stock symbol).
Your employer's payroll, human resources, or accounting department.
Public court documents, if your employer went bankrupt. Oftentimes the EIN will be on the docket sheet along with their name and address.
Still no luck? Then leave the Employer ID Number (EIN) field blank and manually enter your W-2 information. You won't be able to e-file, but you can still file a conventional paper return.
