Do I need to amend if my refund doesn't change or stays the same?
Probably not, but it wouldn't hurt to file an amendment anyway, especially if you had to change or add a form that was reported to the government, like a W-2 or a 1099.

For example, maybe you amended to add a 1099-INT for $16, but it didn't affect your refund or taxes owed. You should go ahead and file the amendment anyway, to avoid possible questions from the government about the missing 1099-INT. For the cost of a postage stamp, it's better to be safe than sorry.
